			<h2>THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF MARIO</h2>
			 <p> Mario, a name that instantly comes to mind when video games are brought up. Mario has had many games over the years over many different consoles but his latest entry MARIO ODYSSEY
			 took things to a whole new level with amazing level design and new game mechanics that can only be described simply as fun. As this website grows we plan to have these tips and tricks
			 pages for all our games but for now please enjoy some tips and trick that I learnt from my playthrough of SUPER MARIO ODYSSEY. </p>
